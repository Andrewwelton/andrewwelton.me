                <h3>Magnet Forensics</h3>
                <p>
                    I spent the last 8 months working at Magnet Forensics, and this post will be a reflection on my time and experiences with the company. Magnet Forensics is a digital forensics company based out of Waterloo, Ontario. For my previous co-op terms, I’ve worked at Christie Digital, and before that, Touch Cat Digital. In comparison to those two companies in terms of size, Magnet falls somewhere in between. They are nowhere near the size of Christie, but significantly larger than Touch Cat Digital. Magnet Forensics developed Internet Evidence Finder, which has been used by government agencies and law enforcement all around the world to investigate devices belonging to suspects.. I was brought onto  a team of people working on a new product for Magnet. When I started, I had no idea what the next 8 months was going to hold for me, but I was ready to find out!

                <h3>Rome</h3>
                <p>
                    The codename for what I was working on at the time was Rome. It was being developed as a replacement for a piece of the existing IEF product. It was written in C# and a desktop application. My previous two co-op terms had been web development positions, so the initial switch to desktop work was a little jarring. The difficulty of the switch was only compounded by the fact that we were using the MVVM (Model, View, View Model) pattern. The pattern wasn’t  something I had used or worked in before, nor was it taught in my classes. The way MVVM works, is there is a data layer known as the Model. This is where all the data from the application comes from and any changes come back through this Model. The View is what displays the data to the user, and this View is controlled and managed by the View Model. The View Model exists to store information and functionality pertaining to the view, and it is how changes will propogate back to the Model or vice versa. On top of that, we were using WPF - which in my prior C# experience I hadn’t used. WPF, also known as Windows Presentation Foundation is an update to WinForms. It is used for building interfaces in C# desktop applications that run on Windows. It looks remarkably similar to HTML, which was fortunate for me because with my previous web development experience I was easily able to get started in WPF and quickly learn how to use WPF effectively. The real benefit I had going into my term with Magnet was that I knew C# as a language and was able to at least understand how the code itself was working and was written. I immediately set a goal for myself to become more familiar with MVVM and how to work in it effectively. The first major task I was given was porting some older code for tagging and commenting on data into the new MVVM pattern for usage in the new product. I thought it would be a great chance to push and learn what I needed. It was a little rough going at first, but my team was always willing to help me get back on track and talk through the problems I was having. I found this helped a lot, and I was able to get up to speed much faster because of how helpful everyone was. I ended up having a lot of back and forth on my code review for this, and other things I worked on early because I was still learning. My coworkers often had things they wanted to see changed in the code I was hoping to submit, and I was honestly glad they did. I wanted my code reviewed so I could see where my mistakes were, and how better to do things so that I don't make the same mistakes twice. My first code reviews led me to another goal of trying to reduce this back and forth and be more productive with the team. It took a little while, but I do think I largely eliminated this problem as I got more used to the product and the standards of what was acceptable. This is something that was even noted during my monthly sync up meetings with my supervisor to see how I was doing. He was impressed at how quickly I was able to bounce back on code reviews and how quickly the back and forth nature subsided.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From there, I started working on various bugs, and trying to branch out and learn different parts of the application. One feature of Rome was the ability to view a scanned file or drive’s hex / text representation. At the time, the feature was an area not many people enjoyed working in, so I took the opportunity to learn more about it. I wanted to learn enough so I could feel confident in working on the hex/text feature. I tried to fix up as much as I could and add in the ability to read different types of files, different drive types, different file systems, and more. As I kept working, I found myself becoming more confident in my abilities. I had less back and forth on my code reviews, and all my monthly performance evaluations were going great. Everyone seemed really happy to have me on the team and working with them, and I absolutely loved being a part of it. Rome eventually got to the point where Magnet was ready to trial beta versions and get feedback. With the advent of beta versions coming, we now needed a way to license the product. It just so happened that I wrapped up my work in time to take on the licensing ticket.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h3>Licensing</h3>
                <p>
                    I had never worked with licensing before, but  I know how important it is to a business who sells software. Without a solid licensing system, you can’t protect your product and people will use it for free. At the time, I didn’t think much of the importance of the beta implementation. I knew that it would be code reviewed, people would accept it, and life would go on. With the help of the team, I got licensing in to a few of the early betas, and I thought that would be the end of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As it turns out, I was wrong: it wasn’t the end of it. It turns out that there was a push from above to improve the licensing for the new product. The old licensing had some areas that needed to be improved , and it wasn’t always the easiest for sales and operations to manage a customer's licenses. The decision was made to roll with a third-party licensing solution. When I heard this was going in, I didn’t think much of it. At the time, someone else had been tasked with implementing the licensing, so I mostly kept working on bugs and features that were pulled into my teams sprints, and kept at it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then,  we found out the person tasked with licensing was leaving the company - and  soon. As fate would have it, I wrapped up what I was working on as the ticket lay unclaimed in our sprint. I grabbed it. Again, licensing is incredibly important.  It can be one of the most important things from a business standpoint when it comes to selling a product. It might not be something that a company wants to entrust to a co-op student.  However, I feel Magnet and my team put an enormous amount of faith and trust in me to do the licensing for the new product, despite all of that. There was absolutely no hesitation or reservations about me doing it that was brought to my attention. They all knew I could, and I knew I could. I had proven myself previously,  as my part time contract was extended for the full 8 months. I had been told I was seen as a full time developer, and not a co-op. I was up for the challenge, and everyone was willing to let me take it.

                <br/>
                <h3>"Did we kill you?"</h3>
                <p>
                    After a few simple and straightforward implementations early on, Magnet  set a release date of May 11th for what was now known as Magnet AXIOM. The date  meant we needed to have a full implementation with feature restrictions and various other requirements in time for launch. Licensing became my primary and only focus. Every day, for more than a month, was licensing work. The work I was doing would enable licensing for both Examine (the team I was a part of) and Process (the other part of the AXIOM product). I would be lying if I said it wasn’t stressful:  it was honestly one of the most stressful things I’ve ever had to do. The requirements of what we needed from licensing sometimes changed 3-4 times a day. On top of that, there was so many unknown factors about the licensing libraries we used; sometimes I was just trying things to see if they would even work because I had no idea. I didn’t have much in the way of resources to turn to for specifics of how the libraries worked, but I honestly feel that I thrived on it. I was learning so much. I had to manage time; I had to become good at giving estimations, talking to managers and product owners about what is possible and what isn’t. I had to make critical design decisions about how licensing was done. All goals I had set for myself personally, and through RecruitGuelph, I felt I was achieving while working on licensing.  It was truly amazing, but it was grueling. The entire company was feeling the squeeze of the May 11th release date. Days grew longer, after work activities lessened, and everyone just pulled together. There were some times where I was working so late, the next day I’d have people asking if licensing had killed me. I knew that my happy-upbeat attitude wasn’t as present as it normally was, but this was just because I knew what the pressure was around what I was doing. I knew how important it was and I refused to consider failure. Towards the end, other people joined me in wrapping up licensing and I was grateful. The night we landed all of the work and effectively licensed AXIOM from that point onward was liberating. It was also terrifying because I had no idea if there would be problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There were problems.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h3>Keep pushing</h3>
                <p>
                    Luckily, we had a few beta releases with my licensing work integrated where any major problems were able to be discovered. As well, everyone internally doing development work had to use a license to do , so we were able to catch a lot of problems internally and get them fixed. I became “the licensing guy”. Questions came to me, and I answered them. Bugs got filed, and I fixed them. The entire company rallied behind AXIOM and we all pushed for it. We would succeed, and we would meet our target date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There were a lot more late nights, a lot more trying times, but we hit the date. Being a part of the push for AXIOM and seeing the whole company rally behind it was an amazing experience. It isn’t something I’ve even come close to feeling anywhere else. I wasn’t working so much because I felt I needed to; it definitely wasn’t  required of me. I was working that much because I wanted to. I wanted to see AXIOM succeed and I was going to do everything in my power to help make sure it happened. I could see that same drive  in everyone else I worked with, as well. The culture at Magnet is one of the things I truly love and admire about the company. Never have I been a part of a company with as strong a feeling of everyone being on the same team as I do and did here. Companies always say they are the same team, but internally it can still feel very divided. I didn’t find this at all at Magnet. Everyone is like minded and it goes a long way towards providing an unbeatable work ethic through the company. I have a tremendous respect for Jad and Adam, and all the other managers and recruiters responsible for hiring such a remarkable group of people. 
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h3>Culture</h3>
                <p>
                    I would like to take the opportunity to touch on some of the culture at Magnet. The company’s culture is honestly amazing. When I was hearing about tech companies like Google, with how they had slides and all these amazing things going on all the time, I didn’t think that it could be true. How could it? Work is work - you do your job to the best of your ability. As time went on, and I started looking into these companies, I found out that while they offer all of these things, they work you very hard. It definitely appeared to me as a “all that glitters is not gold” sort of situation. In contrast, the culture at Magnet is unlike anything I had experienced before. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a deep sense of team responsibility and team ownership at Magnet that made me proud to work there. Everyone was always working towards a common goal and always willing to help each other out. There was no “us and them” mentality between teams, it was only “us”: we were all in it together. I know a lot of companies make similar claims  and promote that same mentality, but Magnet is the only company that actually gave me that experience. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The culture is a large part of why I enjoyed my term so much. The inside jokes we had, both out loud and on HipChat; the mid-day ping pong games; the bus throwing (jokingly volunteering people for tasks we thought they would be good for), everything. Every day was an exciting time to head into the office and get some work done, while having some laughs along the way. I was also lucky enough to be a part of  Magnet’s quarterly events. Every quarter, Magnet gets the whole company together to review what went well during the quarter, what didn’t, what the plan is going forward, and to give back to the employees for the work they do. For the first quarterly event I took part in, we were taken to RIM Park for a day of skating. The second, we were taken to a theatre and watched Top Gun as a company (which was a hilarious time, especially since I hadn’t seen Top Gun before). The transparency Magnet has with its employees is quite honestly astonishing. I’ve never been at a company where we get constant updates as to how much the company is selling, how well we are performing, and what is on the horizon. It’s really nice to be a part of that, and really lends a sense of belonging when you’re given that kind of information.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h3>Post AXIOM Release</h3>
                <p>
                    After the AXIOM release, there was a lot of celebration. We had done it; we pulled it off. We released a solid product and met our deadline. There wasn’t a whole lot of time to rest though, as we had to be fast to respond to customer-reported issues, and continue to round out the feature set and add things that didn’t make the cut the first time around. It was about a month after AXIOM released that I received some of the best news I could have received:I was being offered a full time position with Magnet upon my graduation. Needless to say, I was over the moon that I succeeded. After experiencing the company and being a part of it, I didn’t want to leave. I loved going to work, and didn’t want my co-op term to end. Getting the offer was one of the happiest days I’ve had since I started university, and I can’t wait to return to Magnet when I’m done my schooling. My perseverance in trying to get a job with Magnet had proven to be worth the time and effort, after trying for two years and even failing an interview once. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reflecting on the goals I had set for myself during the AXIOM release, I feel that I have met them all. My communication has definitely improved; I was able to carry on discussions and contribute to architecture and planning conversations around Examine. My confidence in my coding ability has skyrocketed. I felt so comfortable working in Examine, and even if I had to work in an area I hadn’t touched much, I knew I would be able to figure it out. I wanted my team to feel that they could depend on me to contribute, and I knew they could -and they did. We all depended on each other, and we all succeeded as a team. My licensing work had also substantially improved my problem-solving ability. Licensing was almost an entire month of trying to solve one huge problem and a hundred little ones inside of it. I’m much more confident in my ability to look at a problem and find a solution now than I was 8 months ago. I find myself able to step back and see the bigger picture, and I always critique my solution before implementing it to make sure it is actually a good idea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As far as other goals go, I feel that I achieved everything I wanted to during my time at Magnet. I’m graduating with a job, I learned an enormous amount. I feel more confident in my abilities as a programmer after 8 months at Magnet than I've ever felt. I always make a point of setting goals for myself to learn new things on my work terms, and I absolutely achieved that this time around. The work on licensing alone would've make me feel accomplished, but I got to work on so much more during my time there, and I am grateful I was able to. On top of the practical knowledge I gained, I feel that I grew professionally as well. I made some amazing connections with some amazing people, and more importantly I made some lasting friendships with the people I worked with, and will work with again when I return to school. I feel that my overall ability to communicate with people as well has drastically improved from where it was 8 months ago. I find it much easier to articulate my thoughts on a technical matter, and I find it much easier to explain technical problems to someone who might not be as technical as I am used to. I went into Magnet mostly and introvert, and while I still am, it is much easier for me to branch out now than it was before I started at Magnet. I wouldn’t change anything about the way my co-op adventure through university has gone. It got me to where I am now, and I am incredibly happy with where that is.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h3>To everyone I worked with at Magnet...</h3>
                <p>
                    If you end up reading this reflection, I just want to say thank you. Thank you for being patient while I learned things. Thank you for treating me like a real developer and not hiding things “too big” away from the co-op. Thank you for including me in decisions and meetings. Thank you for making me a part of the team. I have honestly never had an experience like I have with Magnet. Every single person I worked with is amazing, and I feel that I am a better person and a better developer because of it. I have grown so much personally and professionally over the 8 months I was at Magnet, and it was in large part because of all of you. For all the ping pong games, the trips to get water, the late night discussions and bug fixes, the board games after work, the parties, the friends, and the laughter, you’re all the reason why these 8 months were so amazing. You’re a part of one of the best companies I’ve ever worked for, and I am incredibly proud to have been a part of it with you. I cannot wait to return, and work on the next project with all of you. You all push me to go the extra mile, and do better than my best.
