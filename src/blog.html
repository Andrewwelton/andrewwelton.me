    <div id="panel1a" class="content active">
      <h3>Magnet Forensics</h3>
      <p>
        I spent the last 8 months working at Magnet Forensics, and this post will be a reflection on my time and experiences with the company. Magnet Forensics is a digital forensics company based out of Waterloo, Ontario. For my previous co-op terms, I’ve worked at Christie Digital, and before that, Touch Cat Digital. In comparison to those two companies in terms of size, Magnet falls somewhere in between. They are nowhere near the size of Christie, but significantly larger than Touch Cat Digital. Magnet Forensics developed Internet Evidence Finder, which has been used by government agencies and law enforcement all around the world to investigate devices belonging to suspects.. I was brought onto  a team of people working on a new product for Magnet. When I started, I had no idea what the next 8 months was going to hold for me, but I was ready to find out!

      <h3>Rome</h3>
      <p>
        The codename for what I was working on at the time was Rome. It was being developed as a replacement for a piece of the existing IEF product. It was written in C# and a desktop application. My previous two co-op terms had been web development positions, so the initial switch to desktop work was a little jarring. The difficulty of the switch was only compounded by the fact that we were using the MVVM (Model, View, View Model) pattern. The pattern wasn’t  something I had used or worked in before, nor was it taught in my classes. The way MVVM works, is there is a data layer known as the Model. This is where all the data from the application comes from and any changes come back through this Model. The View is what displays the data to the user, and this View is controlled and managed by the View Model. The View Model exists to store information and functionality pertaining to the view, and it is how changes will propogate back to the Model or vice versa. On top of that, we were using WPF - which in my prior C# experience I hadn’t used. WPF, also known as Windows Presentation Foundation is an update to WinForms. It is used for building interfaces in C# desktop applications that run on Windows. It looks remarkably similar to HTML, which was fortunate for me because with my previous web development experience I was easily able to get started in WPF and quickly learn how to use WPF effectively. The real benefit I had going into my term with Magnet was that I knew C# as a language and was able to at least understand how the code itself was working and was written. I immediately set a goal for myself to become more familiar with MVVM and how to work in it effectively. The first major task I was given was porting some older code for tagging and commenting on data into the new MVVM pattern for usage in the new product. I thought it would be a great chance to push and learn what I needed. It was a little rough going at first, but my team was always willing to help me get back on track and talk through the problems I was having. I found this helped a lot, and I was able to get up to speed much faster because of how helpful everyone was. I ended up having a lot of back and forth on my code review for this, and other things I worked on early because I was still learning. My coworkers often had things they wanted to see changed in the code I was hoping to submit, and I was honestly glad they did. I wanted my code reviewed so I could see where my mistakes were, and how better to do things so that I don't make the same mistakes twice. My first code reviews led me to another goal of trying to reduce this back and forth and be more productive with the team. It took a little while, but I do think I largely eliminated this problem as I got more used to the product and the standards of what was acceptable. This is something that was even noted during my monthly sync up meetings with my supervisor to see how I was doing. He was impressed at how quickly I was able to bounce back on code reviews and how quickly the back and forth nature subsided.
      </p>
      <p>
        From there, I started working on various bugs, and trying to branch out and learn different parts of the application. One feature of Rome was the ability to view a scanned file or drive’s hex / text representation. At the time, the feature was an area not many people enjoyed working in, so I took the opportunity to learn more about it. I wanted to learn enough so I could feel confident in working on the hex/text feature. I tried to fix up as much as I could and add in the ability to read different types of files, different drive types, different file systems, and more. As I kept working, I found myself becoming more confident in my abilities. I had less back and forth on my code reviews, and all my monthly performance evaluations were going great. Everyone seemed really happy to have me on the team and working with them, and I absolutely loved being a part of it. Rome eventually got to the point where Magnet was ready to trial beta versions and get feedback. With the advent of beta versions coming, we now needed a way to license the product. It just so happened that I wrapped up my work in time to take on the licensing ticket.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h3>Licensing</h3>
      <p>
        I had never worked with licensing before, but  I know how important it is to a business who sells software. Without a solid licensing system, you can’t protect your product and people will use it for free. At the time, I didn’t think much of the importance of the beta implementation. I knew that it would be code reviewed, people would accept it, and life would go on. With the help of the team, I got licensing in to a few of the early betas, and I thought that would be the end of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        As it turns out, I was wrong: it wasn’t the end of it. It turns out that there was a push from above to improve the licensing for the new product. The old licensing had some areas that needed to be improved , and it wasn’t always the easiest for sales and operations to manage a customer's licenses. The decision was made to roll with a third-party licensing solution. When I heard this was going in, I didn’t think much of it. At the time, someone else had been tasked with implementing the licensing, so I mostly kept working on bugs and features that were pulled into my teams sprints, and kept at it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then,  we found out the person tasked with licensing was leaving the company - and  soon. As fate would have it, I wrapped up what I was working on as the ticket lay unclaimed in our sprint. I grabbed it. Again, licensing is incredibly important.  It can be one of the most important things from a business standpoint when it comes to selling a product. It might not be something that a company wants to entrust to a co-op student.  However, I feel Magnet and my team put an enormous amount of faith and trust in me to do the licensing for the new product, despite all of that. There was absolutely no hesitation or reservations about me doing it that was brought to my attention. They all knew I could, and I knew I could. I had proven myself previously,  as my part time contract was extended for the full 8 months. I had been told I was seen as a full time developer, and not a co-op. I was up for the challenge, and everyone was willing to let me take it.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h3>"Did we kill you?"</h3>
      <p>
        After a few simple and straightforward implementations early on, Magnet  set a release date of May 11th for what was now known as Magnet AXIOM. The date  meant we needed to have a full implementation with feature restrictions and various other requirements in time for launch. Licensing became my primary and only focus. Every day, for more than a month, was licensing work. The work I was doing would enable licensing for both Examine (the team I was a part of) and Process (the other part of the AXIOM product). I would be lying if I said it wasn’t stressful:  it was honestly one of the most stressful things I’ve ever had to do. The requirements of what we needed from licensing sometimes changed 3-4 times a day. On top of that, there was so many unknown factors about the licensing libraries we used; sometimes I was just trying things to see if they would even work because I had no idea. I didn’t have much in the way of resources to turn to for specifics of how the libraries worked, but I honestly feel that I thrived on it. I was learning so much. I had to manage time; I had to become good at giving estimations, talking to managers and product owners about what is possible and what isn’t. I had to make critical design decisions about how licensing was done. All goals I had set for myself personally, and through RecruitGuelph, I felt I was achieving while working on licensing.  It was truly amazing, but it was grueling. The entire company was feeling the squeeze of the May 11th release date. Days grew longer, after work activities lessened, and everyone just pulled together. There were some times where I was working so late, the next day I’d have people asking if licensing had killed me. I knew that my happy-upbeat attitude wasn’t as present as it normally was, but this was just because I knew what the pressure was around what I was doing. I knew how important it was and I refused to consider failure. Towards the end, other people joined me in wrapping up licensing and I was grateful. The night we landed all of the work and effectively licensed AXIOM from that point onward was liberating. It was also terrifying because I had no idea if there would be problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were problems.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h3>Keep pushing</h3>
      <p>
        Luckily, we had a few beta releases with my licensing work integrated where any major problems were able to be discovered. As well, everyone internally doing development work had to use a license to do , so we were able to catch a lot of problems internally and get them fixed. I became “the licensing guy”. Questions came to me, and I answered them. Bugs got filed, and I fixed them. The entire company rallied behind AXIOM and we all pushed for it. We would succeed, and we would meet our target date.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were a lot more late nights, a lot more trying times, but we hit the date. Being a part of the push for AXIOM and seeing the whole company rally behind it was an amazing experience. It isn’t something I’ve even come close to feeling anywhere else. I wasn’t working so much because I felt I needed to; it definitely wasn’t  required of me. I was working that much because I wanted to. I wanted to see AXIOM succeed and I was going to do everything in my power to help make sure it happened. I could see that same drive  in everyone else I worked with, as well. The culture at Magnet is one of the things I truly love and admire about the company. Never have I been a part of a company with as strong a feeling of everyone being on the same team as I do and did here. Companies always say they are the same team, but internally it can still feel very divided. I didn’t find this at all at Magnet. Everyone is like minded and it goes a long way towards providing an unbeatable work ethic through the company. I have a tremendous respect for Jad and Adam, and all the other managers and recruiters responsible for hiring such a remarkable group of people. 
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h3>Culture</h3>
      <p>
        I would like to take the opportunity to touch on some of the culture at Magnet. The company’s culture is honestly amazing. When I was hearing about tech companies like Google, with how they had slides and all these amazing things going on all the time, I didn’t think that it could be true. How could it? Work is work - you do your job to the best of your ability. As time went on, and I started looking into these companies, I found out that while they offer all of these things, they work you very hard. It definitely appeared to me as a “all that glitters is not gold” sort of situation. In contrast, the culture at Magnet is unlike anything I had experienced before. 
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a deep sense of team responsibility and team ownership at Magnet that made me proud to work there. Everyone was always working towards a common goal and always willing to help each other out. There was no “us and them” mentality between teams, it was only “us”: we were all in it together. I know a lot of companies make similar claims  and promote that same mentality, but Magnet is the only company that actually gave me that experience. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The culture is a large part of why I enjoyed my term so much. The inside jokes we had, both out loud and on HipChat; the mid-day ping pong games; the bus throwing (jokingly volunteering people for tasks we thought they would be good for), everything. Every day was an exciting time to head into the office and get some work done, while having some laughs along the way. I was also lucky enough to be a part of  Magnet’s quarterly events. Every quarter, Magnet gets the whole company together to review what went well during the quarter, what didn’t, what the plan is going forward, and to give back to the employees for the work they do. For the first quarterly event I took part in, we were taken to RIM Park for a day of skating. The second, we were taken to a theatre and watched Top Gun as a company (which was a hilarious time, especially since I hadn’t seen Top Gun before). The transparency Magnet has with its employees is quite honestly astonishing. I’ve never been at a company where we get constant updates as to how much the company is selling, how well we are performing, and what is on the horizon. It’s really nice to be a part of that, and really lends a sense of belonging when you’re given that kind of information.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h3>Post AXIOM Release</h3>
      <p>
        After the AXIOM release, there was a lot of celebration. We had done it; we pulled it off. We released a solid product and met our deadline. There wasn’t a whole lot of time to rest though, as we had to be fast to respond to customer-reported issues, and continue to round out the feature set and add things that didn’t make the cut the first time around. It was about a month after AXIOM released that I received some of the best news I could have received:I was being offered a full time position with Magnet upon my graduation. Needless to say, I was over the moon that I succeeded. After experiencing the company and being a part of it, I didn’t want to leave. I loved going to work, and didn’t want my co-op term to end. Getting the offer was one of the happiest days I’ve had since I started university, and I can’t wait to return to Magnet when I’m done my schooling. My perseverance in trying to get a job with Magnet had proven to be worth the time and effort, after trying for two years and even failing an interview once. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Reflecting on the goals I had set for myself during the AXIOM release, I feel that I have met them all. My communication has definitely improved; I was able to carry on discussions and contribute to architecture and planning conversations around Examine. My confidence in my coding ability has skyrocketed. I felt so comfortable working in Examine, and even if I had to work in an area I hadn’t touched much, I knew I would be able to figure it out. I wanted my team to feel that they could depend on me to contribute, and I knew they could -and they did. We all depended on each other, and we all succeeded as a team. My licensing work had also substantially improved my problem-solving ability. Licensing was almost an entire month of trying to solve one huge problem and a hundred little ones inside of it. I’m much more confident in my ability to look at a problem and find a solution now than I was 8 months ago. I find myself able to step back and see the bigger picture, and I always critique my solution before implementing it to make sure it is actually a good idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as other goals go, I feel that I achieved everything I wanted to during my time at Magnet. I’m graduating with a job, I learned an enormous amount. I feel more confident in my abilities as a programmer after 8 months at Magnet than I've ever felt. I always make a point of setting goals for myself to learn new things on my work terms, and I absolutely achieved that this time around. The work on licensing alone would've make me feel accomplished, but I got to work on so much more during my time there, and I am grateful I was able to. On top of the practical knowledge I gained, I feel that I grew professionally as well. I made some amazing connections with some amazing people, and more importantly I made some lasting friendships with the people I worked with, and will work with again when I return to school. I feel that my overall ability to communicate with people as well has drastically improved from where it was 8 months ago. I find it much easier to articulate my thoughts on a technical matter, and I find it much easier to explain technical problems to someone who might not be as technical as I am used to. I went into Magnet mostly and introvert, and while I still am, it is much easier for me to branch out now than it was before I started at Magnet. I wouldn’t change anything about the way my co-op adventure through university has gone. It got me to where I am now, and I am incredibly happy with where that is.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h3>To everyone I worked with at Magnet...</h3>
      <p>
        If you end up reading this reflection, I just want to say thank you. Thank you for being patient while I learned things. Thank you for treating me like a real developer and not hiding things “too big” away from the co-op. Thank you for including me in decisions and meetings. Thank you for making me a part of the team. I have honestly never had an experience like I have with Magnet. Every single person I worked with is amazing, and I feel that I am a better person and a better developer because of it. I have grown so much personally and professionally over the 8 months I was at Magnet, and it was in large part because of all of you. For all the ping pong games, the trips to get water, the late night discussions and bug fixes, the board games after work, the parties, the friends, and the laughter, you’re all the reason why these 8 months were so amazing. You’re a part of one of the best companies I’ve ever worked for, and I am incredibly proud to have been a part of it with you. I cannot wait to return, and work on the next project with all of you. You all push me to go the extra mile, and do better than my best.

    <a href="#panel2a">August 2015 - Reflection On 4 Months at Christie Digital Systems</a>
    <div id="panel2a" class="content">
      <h3>Christie Digital</h3>
      <p>
        I spent the last 4 months working at <a href="http://www.christiedigital.ca" target = "_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christie Digital</a>, and this post is a reflection on my experience at the company. I originally accepted a position as an Agile Software Developer in C++, but after arriving I had been retasked to the web interface which was written in Typescript. While I was at Christie, I worked on improving the web interface and developing new features for the new <a href="http://www.christiedigital.com/en-us/business/products/projectors/3-chip-dlp/boxer/Pages/Boxer-4K30.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boxer 4K30</a> as requested by the product owners. The Boxer is one of Christie's newest projectors and boasts some rather impressive advantages over the competition. Compared to my previous co-op work term, I had the opportunity to work in a team and be part of something larger than myself. It was a great learning experience for me and I'm grateful for the chance. I learned that compared to working at a small company like Touch Cat, I would really rather work at a bigger company. Not necessarily the same size as Christie, but I find I thrive with a group of people around me working on the same project.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h3>Improving On Myself</h3>
      <p>
        What I wanted to get out of my time at Christie was the ability to work in a team, and I definitely feel as though I have come out of this co-op term with this ability. Working alone at Touch Cat taught me a lot about figuring problems out on my own and being independent, but working alone is not always an option. It was a different experience at first, having several other teams around me that would be providing information, or providing the backend API for the feature I was developing, but I found that I was able to quickly adapt. I was given a paired programming partner for the term as well. All the experience with paired programming I've had during school was negative, so I was a little worried at first. It ended up being a really good experience and having someone to work with helped me get past a lot of the problems I had when working alone, mainly having someone to bounce ideas off of and talk problems through with. I felt as though my productivity was sky high, and this was validated by the pair of us consistently being done all of our sprint goals before the first half of the sprint was even finished.
      </p>
      <h3>The "Agile" Experience</h3>
      <p>
        I've learned about Agile from class, so I thought it would be easy to adapt to when I got to Christie. In reality, most of what I knew about Agile didn't really apply at Christie: they employ their own version of Agile which they've developed themselves throughout the years through trial and error. It's a little different in the sense that the UI design and user stories come outside of the sprint cycle and our sprints are actually only really for development work. Traditionally, with Agile, all of the work would be done within the sprint. The Agile method employed at Christie wasn't really an issue; in fact it worked really well for the most part. The only time there were ever any issues with Christie's method were towards the end of my time there when we wound up stuck waiting on UI/UX specifications and had some dead time during a sprint. In these cases, we explored tasks outside of our scheduled sprint goals. There was a lot of refactoring of old and hard to understand web code. One of my goals for the term was to continue working on my communication skills, as I had identified this as an area I needed to improve during my time at Touch Cat. I know that after my time at Christie I have accomplished this goal: I feel much more comfortable explaining problems to others and communicating the how and why of my ideas to them. Having stand up meetings and describing what I'm working on and any troubles I'm facing every morning was a great asset to me as it gave me the chance to practice my communication every morning. Additionally, I had a significant amount more web experience than my pair programming partner, so I practiced my communication with him explaining how different aspects of web development worked.
      </p>
      <h3>Creativity</h3>
      <p>
        After working at Christie for a while and interacting with the UI/UX teams, I started to really get interested in the design of the web interface itself. Web work is inherently user facing and the web interface was being given the "First Class" treatment for the new product I was working on. I wanted to start learning more about why the decisions were made in the way they were and why the interface was set up to work the way it does. I really enjoyed having UI experts working with me so I could bounce UI ideas and changes off of them. Some of my ideas they actually liked and I was able to implement them into the features I was working on. Towards the end of my time at Christie, the web interface had run out of work as all our features were finished and no new features could be started as we were approaching feature complete. This gave us the opportunity to work on some side projects for the company. With these projects I was given full creative liberty with the design. Together, my partner and I built a JSON RPC command builder, which we thought would be a great asset to developers working on the project after we leave. It would allow users to connect to a projector and be guided through the construction of a command which can then be sent to the projector itself automatically. We were given full reign over the actual interface design, so we tried to make it as clean and intuitive as possible and I think we came up with a really good solution. Additionally, we took the time to build a responsive prototype version of the web interface as its current iteration is not responsive. For those of you reading who don't know what responsive design is, it's when content reshapes to fit the container it is in. When the screen is small, the content looks natural on the device. Working on this prototype was another chance to get creative as the layout was hardcoded for a fixed size, so in order to make it responsive, we had to redesign a number of elements to get it to look responsive. It came out really well, but due to the massive time investment that would be needed to convert the UI to responsive, it is unlikely to happen in the lifespan of this product. Perhaps in a new product further down the line, they will use our prototype as a basis for how to design the interface. The project also presented me with an opportunity to practice my communication skills even further as we then presented this responsive prototype to the product owners and several other key managers within the organization. Giving a presentation like this infront of upper management and product owners is something I've never had the chance to do before. It was a really enjoyable experience for me and it is definitely something I want to try and do more, both in future co-op work terms and personally through events like GCC at Guelph.
      </p>
      <h3>In Closing</h3>
      <p>
        Christie Digital was a great employer. It gave me exactly what I was looking for in a coop term. I was able to work in a team and improve my skills as a programmer. I was a little disappointed to be doing more web work when I originally thought I'd be doing C++ and learning something new, but I'm still thankful for the experience. The team experience I received was invaluable to me. I know that I can enter a team of programmers and be able to be an asset now after my time at Christie and I know that this skill will help me greatly in the future. I learned a few more intricacies about web development and learned a lot about build systems which is valuable experience to have. It reminds me of something I've been told as a programmer over and over: "Programming is a skill, and you need to practice it to get better." After working at Christie, I feel that I got a lot of practice and actually became a better programmer, which at the end of the day is what coop is all about. I work to learn, gain experience and get better so that when I graduate I know how to function in a company and work towards a goal instead of just completing basic homework tasks. Additionally, the focus on web work lit a fire under me to get working on some personal projects, so I took it upon myself to start learning Android development. I've got an app I'm working on that I'm making good progress on. I've additionally started planning for a game I'll be developing in Unity. I also took the time to set up a server on Digital Ocean, register a domain and move my entire website onto its own stand alone website. This also allows me the freedom to provide a backend for my Android app through Node.JS. The time I spent at Christie Digital made me a better programmer, and I look forward to the road ahead of me and whatever it may hold.

    <a href="#panel3a">December 2014 - Reflection On 8 Months at Touch Cat Digital</a>
    <div id="panel3a" class="content">
      <h3>Touch Cat Digital</h3>
      <p>
        I spent the last 8 months working at <a href="http://www.touchcatdigital.ca/en/home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Touch Cat Digital</a>, and this post is simply a reflection on my time there. Touch Cat Digital is a small Web and Mobile development company based out of Etobicoke, Ontario. Compared to other companies, it didn't really feel like a "startup"; there was an already established client base, and the company has been around for a while. However, as far as company size goes, it was definitely small. By small, I mean I was one of <b>two</b> employees working there. Having the opportunity to work with the CEO of the company on a daily basis was a really interesting experience. I was able to receive constant feedback on my code and what I was working on, which was very valuable to me.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h3>Become a Better Programmer</h3>
      <p>
        The main thing I wanted to accomplish personally while I was working at Touch Cat was to just become more confident with my skills as a programmer. Prior to starting, I felt like my code was "never good enough." I didn't have much confidence in my abilities and it was hindering me from being able to try and develop things on my own. I can say that after about 4 months at Touch Cat, with the guidance and encouragement of Andrew, I became much more confident in my ability as well as a noticeably improved coder. Part of what helped me with this was the approach I had to take while working. I was almost immediately thrown into the pre-existing framework and told to add a smattering of new features to it. I had never worked with web code before, let alone work in PHP, but it was sink or swim. (To a certain extent, he certainly wasn't going to let me drown). It was tough going for the first few weeks, but Andrew helped me and guided me towards the right direction and before long I got the hang of it. This led to another goal I had come up with, which was to be able to articulate what I wanted to do and what I was having problems with in a coherent way. I typically described what I wanted to do or my problems using terms such as "move the thing here." My descriptions were all much too vague for anyone to reasonably help me. Andrew noted this to me several times and I started consciously making the effort to catch myself and describe my problems effectively. Before long, I started flying through bug fixes and feature tickets and then Andrew started to hint at what he wanted me to do for a big project. With my budding confidence and new found programming knowledge I was eager to start.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h3>Venturing into the Unknown</h3>
      <p>
        The big project that was assigned to me was to take an idea that Andrew had, and turn it into reality. I was to take the command line utility he built for handling images taken at FanExpo-esque events and turn it into a fully featured product. The scope of this project was immense, but I was eager to get started. I started on the project by building the rest of the functionality in while on the command line. I decided it would be easier to debug and get the complex aspects working on the command line first, then attach a GUI to it later. This approach was similar to what I did in CIS 2750, and it worked out very well there. The approach from 2750 worked very well for this project as well. The main goal of the application was to be able to detect where the people were in an image, and crop out the extra background around the people before sending it to the printer. I haven't taken the Image Processing course provided at the university yet, so this was entirely new territory for me. I'd never even looked into anything to do with image processing. I spent a large amount of time reading articles on stack overflow and personal blogs of various people who had done similar things before. Luckily, I was able to pick up C# rather quickly; I found it similar enough to C that I was comfortable in it. This project taught me a lot about approaching something I've never done, or trying to accomplish a complex goal. It took a lot of trial and error. I tried many different approaches and the vast majority of them were failures. There was about a month and a half long stretch where every single thing I had tried to get closer to the goal did not work. It was really easy to get discouraged and down on myself about it, but Andrew was very encouraging and kept me positive. He guided me along the path he thought I should take, even though he didn't know how to accomplish it either.

      <h3>Designing a UI</h3>
      <p>
        After what seemed like forever with trial and error, I eventually had a method that was fully functional and worked exactly as intended. Running the method against a series of 20+ pictures of varying complexity yielded results that were usable. Now this means it was time to attach the GUI. The one thing Andrew did with this project was to give me mostly free reign to design the UI however I wished. Since it was a Windows specific application, I decided to take a "Metro UI" style approach to the UI. This was a big deal for me because UI design is something I had always wanted to do, and Andrew was giving me the chance to do just that. He gave me requirements of things the UI had to have or had to do, but other than that it was up to me. Below is a few images of the UI I created for this software.

      <h3>Fixing Old Mistakes and Optimizing Code</h3>
      <p>
        Once the UI was done, it was time to clean up. The program itself was horribly inefficient with memory. While processing, it would use close to 1.2GB of RAM. After using some memory leak detection tools, we managed to get the peak usage down to roughly 200MB, and it no longer leaked memory. Then came the new features that Andrew had wanted to add. He wanted the ability to remotely control cameras from the application. This way the user could take the picture and have it downloaded from the camera automatically. This was another interesting and new experience for me. I had to use Canon and Nikon camera SDKs. I loaded their classes into the program and then would make the specific calls to the specific SDKs, depending on what type of camera was connected. Unfortunately, I never had the chance to test this code, but I followed their spec and provided their spec was correct, the code itself should work.

      <h3>GCC Tech Talk</h3>
      <p>
        Completing this project was an amazing experience. Being able to take something from an idea to a finished product was an experience few people get, especially in their first co-op term. Another amazing experience I got as a result of my co-op placement was that I was able to give a tech talk about what I had worked on. Andrew gave me the go ahead and I gave a GCC (Guelph Coding Community) tech talk on the project. This garnered some interest from Dr. Dan Gillis, who has informed me of an image processing 4900 idea he has. I am definitely tempted to take him up on this offer in my next semester of school.

      <h3>Shifting Gears</h3>
      <p>
        With this project behind me, my next task was to revamp Andrew's administration tool and port most of its functionality over into a new framework he had been working on. It was a big change of pace from what I had been working on before, but it was nice to return to PHP and Javascript work. By the time my placement came to an end, I had successfully ported over his administration tool to his new framework. Additionally, because of how well the printing app came out UI wise, Andrew gave me the opportunity to create the UI for the administration tool as well. His only restriction was that he wanted it "flat" and to follow some of the <a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Material Design</a> guidelines. Unfortunately, this is not something I can provide pictures of as it is largely internal, but I take pride in the fact that before long, his clients will be using my administration tools to manage the content on their websites.

      <h3>Closing Words</h3>
      <p>
        In closing, I am immensely thankful to Andrew for taking me on as an 8 month co-op. The job was an amazing experience, and I learned a lot more than I had during my first few years at school. I was able to accomplish the most important goal I set for myself while working here. My confidence in my abilities was shaky at best before starting, but I feel like a much stronger coder now. I'm no longer intimidated by big scale projects because I know how to tackle them. I can also feel comfortable that my code is well written and understandable. I achieved my goal of being better able to relay my thoughts and problems about coding related problems without using terms like "this thing is broken" or "x doesn't work when y is true." For little things like that, I can express my problems in ways that not only make sense but also make it easier for someone to help me with my problem after hearing the description. I wouldn't trade my experience at Touch Cat Digital for anything else. I got to do something that few co-op students, let alone first term co-op students get to do: I took an idea from start to finish. That experience was invaluable and I am so glad I had the opportunity to do it. I would easily recommend any co-op students who want a unique and deeply rewarding work term to apply to Touch Cat Digital.

    <a href="#panel4a">July 11th 2014 - Filters and Object Detection</a>
    <div id="panel4a" class="content">
      <p>
        This week, the first thing I did was build an image "sharpening" filter. The idea behind this was to try and sharpen images subtly enough to really make them "pop" when put out for printing. It took a day or two to really find examples of how to apply matrices to a bitmap in C# in order to create the desired effect. I found countless examples that I could not for the life of me get functioning, but after some digging and reading around on some specific image manipulation in C# blogs, I managed to find some examples of code that did in fact work, and worked rather quickly to sharpen said images. I put together a couple of filters: a few with a very strong sharpen effect, and a few with a much more subtle effect. I could go through them and remove the useless ones later, and narrow down to an effective sharpen later on. I also started to look into what the best approach for actually detecting people in an image would be. I had never read about anything like this project before, but I was fairly sure that I had seen other software capable of sharpening images before, so it was surely possible. It was just a matter of putting the time in to actually figure out how it's done. Andrew suggested I start with "Colour Elimination." Most of the images I had as samples to work with used the standard photography cloudy backgrounds. If I could get an average colour of the background, finding the people in the image should be made easy as their average colour should be vastly different from the background. This seemed like a really good place to start, so it is what I planned to go with.

    <div id="panel5a" class="content">
      <p>
        This week I started to look at what my big "project" is going to be during my time at Touch Cat Digital. There is some printer software that has already been developed for FanExpo and FanExpo-esque events. It essentially handles taking pictures from a folder, applying a barcode, resizing to fit the printer paper and sending it to an available printer. The big picture goal is to revamp this command line tool into a fully featured GUI application. The photo resizing needs to be updated to not distort images and center on the printer paper and the major feature is to provide an "automatic" cropping mode, wherein the subject of the photo is cropped from the background with minimal background left behind. Knowing what this is supposed to look like at the end is extremely daunting. This is so much more complex than anything I've even attempted to develop before, including the massive 2750 project we had to construct in the semester before my co-op started. I need to remind myself to tackle smaller broken down problems individually, as opposed to trying to solve the entirety of the problem right from the get go. First things first... revamp all the photo handling. I can worry about the GUI once I have a functional base on the command line.
        <br/>
        I also think that it might be for the best to change the format of my blog posts to a weekly "reflection" on the prior week. With the scope of what I'm working on, taking stock of the week seems much more valuable.

    <div id="panel6a" class="content">
      <p>My PHP time has ended for the time being. It's now time to switch gears into C#. Just like PHP, I've never actually used C# before this point. I'm hoping that I can pick up the ins and outs of C# rather quickly considering I already have a pretty solid grasp on C and how C works. From what I've seen so far, it all looks very familiar, so my hopes are high for this. There are some pretty ambitious website goals, and I'm now getting some experience working under a deadline. The site needs to be able to be made live by roughly August if it ends up being in use. I just need to remember to work effectively and not rush my work. I need to work more quickly than I have, so I'm hoping there isn't some huge hurdle to learning C# that will throw me off.</p>

      <p>"Hey Andrew, check your tickets. I found a bunch of bugs on the site you need to fix ASAP." Oh god, it happened overnight. All my work fell apart,
      the entire site is broken, it's the end of the world. I've failed! All thoughts that raced through my mind when I got into work to be greeted by the news that my code is not working.
      Luckily, they were easy fixes, small simple things that I just missed or didn't account for while working on the site in the first place. Before starting, I'd always
      heard the stories of people going in to find everything falling apart around them and always thought "Oh it can't be that bad. It won't suck that much." But it did.
      I felt awful. My boss, Andrew, however did an amazing job in assuring me that it was fine. I sat down, put on my headphones and pounded out the tickets, fixing up all the
      bugs and getting them pushed to live. My first hot-fixes! What a feeling!</p>

    <a href="#panel8a">June 20th 2014 - Here's to a RESTful Weekend</a>
    <div id="panel8a" class="content">
      <p>The past few days I've been working on a RESTful API to add into the suite provided when assembling a site in the Touch Cat framework. Before starting here I had no idea what REST was, or what made something "RESTful", but with some assistance and a lot of reading, I've created one. I built it in PHP and set it up in such a way that it can easily be inherited from and overloaded in order to make specific calls to API's. Mediafire and flickr are the two examples that will actually be used. We wanted to add the ability for a user to use a flickr photostream to source images for slideshows on the website. With this API in place, the functionality is now available, which admittedly is pretty cool to see in action. As for Mediafire, having the ability to upload a file to a company owned mediafire account is a pretty useful ability to have, and once again with this API in place, it is now possible to actually do this. I was very pleased with how this turned out, and I came out with the added knowledge of how to create a proper HTML request.</p>

      From the time I started, until today, all my work was focused on this website. I learned so much from working. I became more familiar with PHP, Javascript, HTML and CSS.
      Having never touched any of these languages before, having all of this under my belt so quickly was a very nice change of pace. It also helped tremendously with my confidence.
      Before starting this co-op work term, my confidence in my abilities was shaky at best. From working hard on this website and constantly learning more I finally feel
      like this is something I could realistically do for the rest of my life.</p>
