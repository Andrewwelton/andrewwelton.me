<h3>I Wanna See That!</h3>
<p>I Wanna See That! is an Android app currently in development. It will allow you to figure out what previews played before movies currently in theatres. It will also allow you to keep track of movies that you want to see with reminders of the release date if the movie is pending release.</p>
<p>The app is currently on Github but on a Private Repo. The repo will be made public once more work has been done.</p>

<h3>Untitled Unity Project</h3>
<p>I am going to learn Unity and have an idea for a game I'm going to build. More details to come once this project is further underway.</p>
