  My name is Andrew Welton. I'm a 21 year old Software Engineering major at the University of Guelph. I just finished an 8 month work term so I'm technically somewhere in my third year right now. I love live music, concerts are definitely a huge part of my life. I also love programming and coming up with ideas of things to build. I've got a few ideas floating around that I've been planning to start and put into action soon and they will most likely be found on my Github which you can find linked above. You can find me on any social media sites from the links above as well, and below you can find my current resume. Send me a message or email me at <a href="mailto:awelton@mail.uoguelph.ca">awelton@mail.uoguelph.ca</a> if you have any questions or want to chat. Check out my blog for stories about what I've done so far. I promise to try and post more frequently and about more than just co-op.
